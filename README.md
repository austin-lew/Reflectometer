# Reflectometer
## Motivation
Reflective surfaces are difficult to characterize due to the inconsistency of the image being reflected. We therefore want a way to identify how reflective a surface is, reliably and accurately.

## Description
A custom implementation of the Canny edge detection algorithm with interpolated non-max suppression and automatic threshold generation.
